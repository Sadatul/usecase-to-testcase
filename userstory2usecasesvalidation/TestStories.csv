"A library issues loan items to each customer. Each customer is known as a member and is issued a membership card that shows a unique member number. It is necessary that the membership number and other details on a customer must be kept such as a name, address, and date-of-birth. The library is made up of a number of subject sections. Each section is denoted by a classification-mark. A loan item is identified by a bar-code. There are exactly two types of loan items, language tapes, and books. A language tape has a titlelanguage, and level. A book has a title, and author(s). It is possibility that each customer may borrow up to at most 8 items. It is possibility that each item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend a current loan. When an item is issued the customer's membership-number is scanned via a bar code reader or entered manually. If the membership is valid and the number of items on loan at most 8, the book's bar-code is read, either via the bar code reader or entered manually. It is possibility that if the item can be issued the item is stamped and then issued. It is necessary that the library must support the facility for an item to be searched and for a daily update of records"
"The bank client application must enable deposits to and withdrawals from accounts, with each transaction meticulously recorded, including date, time, transaction type, amount, and the account balance post-transaction, and clients must be able to review all transactions for a given account. Clients can have two account types, checking and saving, where each checking account can be linked to one saving account, and access is secured via a personal identification number (PIN) code. Neither checking nor saving accounts are permitted to have a negative balance; if a checking account withdrawal exceeds its current balance, the application must automatically draw funds from the linked saving account, but if the saving account's balance is insufficient, the transaction will be terminated, and the user informed."
"The Time Monitor Software System primarily serves two functions: allowing developers to record timestamp data via a web browser into a database, and enabling managers to analyze these records. Each timestamp record captures the duration of a specific activity and is uniquely identified by a combination of the project, user, and the date the activity occurred. The activity itself is described by a task name, an activity, and an artefact. For managerial analysis, dates are often framed in terms of the current week, which spans from the Monday immediately preceding the current day to the Sunday immediately following it, inclusively. A task represents a unit of work defined by the manager, for which developers are accountable, and is a scheduled component with defined start and end dates (e.g., ""Implement module A"" or ""Design library XYZ""). Developers typically work on assigned tasks, and there can be a many-to-many relationship between developers and tasks, meaning one developer can work on multiple tasks, and one task can involve multiple developers."
"The user initiates the process by placing either a dish or a cup onto the belt. As the belt moves, it carries the part toward the vision system. When a part enters the vision system's sensor zone, the vision system detects it and promptly signals the belt to stop. The vision system then identifies the type of part (dish or cup) and relays this information to the robot. The robot, equipped with two arms, then picks up the part from the belt, allowing the belt to resume movement. The assembly is complete once both a dish and a cup have been placed separately onto the tray by the robot's arms."
"A pet owner with an active VetConnect account may register multiple pets, each with unique profiles containing vaccination history, breed-specific health alerts, and dietary preferences. Using the app, the user can book virtual consultations with licensed veterinarians, upload photos or videos of pet symptoms, and receive prescriptions digitally. After the consultation, the app provides a follow-up checklist, medication reminders, and direct links to order pet meds online. For emergencies, users can tap an SOS button to get connected to a 24/7 vet hotline within 60 seconds."
"A verified patient logged into the MediChain platform can access and manage their entire medical history, including past diagnoses, prescriptions, lab reports, and imaging files, which are securely stored on a decentralized ledger. The patient may grant time-limited access to selected records for a specific physician or medical institution via a QR code or secure token. Once access is granted, the physician can view but not alter the data. The patient is notified of every access event. This ensures full control and traceability over their sensitive medical data."
"A registered farmer using the FarmWise mobile application may log their daily crop activities, such as seeding, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, by selecting from a guided checklist. The system automatically tags each entry with geolocation and timestamp data, and syncs the data with regional weather records. The farmer may later view a dashboard summarizing crop health trends and receive AI-generated recommendations tailored to their crop type and zone. In case of recurring pest outbreaks or unusual weather patterns, the platform also alerts neighboring farmers to take preventive actions."
"A registered user on the MindBloom app, which supports mental health tracking and therapy, may create a personalized wellness plan by selecting focus areas such as anxiety, sleep, or emotional resilience. The app prompts users to complete daily mood check-ins using sliders and journal entries. Based on these inputs, MindBloom generates weekly summaries and suggests evidence-based coping strategies, mindfulness exercises, or CBT modules. Users may also schedule virtual therapy sessions with licensed professionals, with all session notes securely stored for ongoing care. In cases where the app detects warning signs of a mental health crisis (e.g., prolonged distress or severe mood dips), it offers direct access to crisis support resources and optional emergency contact alerts."
